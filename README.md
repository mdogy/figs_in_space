# Figs in Space

A single-page PhaserJS homage to classic vector shooters — now starring
fig-shaped asteroids and the "Figs in Space" attract loop.

## Development

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

``` bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, typically at
`http://localhost:5173`. The server includes hot module replacement
(HMR) for instant updates as you edit the code.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

``` bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be output to the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

``` bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure
